Especially during covid when you want to fit out your home office with basic needs (mouse, printer, shredder etc) - you have to buy a cheap mouse for e.g. because a good quality one one get approved.

The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

I was in Ship Dock and was loading 2-3k boxes a day (about 50k lbs a day) onto trucks while scanning, lifting boxes, loading and pushing carts, and not only was I only making 15 an hour, but my bosses didn't care one bit about the extra effort I put in. In fact, they knew how hard I worked and made me do it all day, every day, and gave the people who were lazy better roles like Training Ambassador. It really felt like I was killing myself each day at work without recognition. The boss made some disrespectful comments to me and I even got hit in the head with a heavy box because he broke a safety rule while loading a truck. For what I was doing, the kind of work and the level of effort I was putting it, I should have been getting paid at least 18 an hour, if not 20. So, I decided that I needed a change from that department. That was just my experience there. Many agree that it's not the best working environment in that department and that many roles are unfair, but it is what it is and there's nothing you can do but speak up and do what you have to do for yourself. Mostly, everyone else that I've met at Amazon is great. I love working there.
