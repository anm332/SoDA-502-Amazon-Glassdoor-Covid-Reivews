-work is repetitive and can be slow at times
-normal schedules are work 4 days, rest for 3. They will throw in a mandatory week and make you work 10+ days in a row.
-Management/HR does NOT care about their workers. You are just a worker ant they can dispose of anytime they want to and will not address schedule and health concerns.
-Don't work here if you don't have good shoes and aren't used to hard labor. 
-Micro managers keep track of how you do your job and you're either marked as a decent worker or a bad one. People are lucky to be labeled as decent. The rest are fired to let new employees in
-Management just roams throughout the workday. Hard to find if you are in need of help

313,12,"Extremely hard work, depending on your role/department. I was in Ship Dock and was loading 2-3k boxes a day (about 50k lbs a day) onto trucks while scanning, lifting boxes, loading and pushing carts, and not only was I only making 15 an hour, but my bosses didn't care one bit about the extra effort I put in. In fact, they knew how hard I worked and made me do it all day, every day, and gave the people who were lazy better roles like Training Ambassador. It really felt like I was killing myself each day at work without recognition. The boss made some disrespectful comments to me and I even got hit in the head with a heavy box because he broke a safety rule while loading a truck. For what I was doing, the kind of work and the level of effort I was putting it, I should have been getting paid at least 18 an hour, if not 20. So, I decided that I needed a change from that department. That was just my experience there. Many agree that it's not the best working environment in that department and that many roles are unfair, but it is what it is and there's nothing you can do but speak up and do what you have to do for yourself. Mostly, everyone else that I've met at Amazon is great. I love working there.
